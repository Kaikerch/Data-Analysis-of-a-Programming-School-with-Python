# Data Analysis of a Programming School with Python

> Status: Concluded

In this project, in Google Colaboratory, I analyzed data from students and courses at a programming school using two files with different extensions, json files for students and html files for courses.
*Step by step:
- Using the pandas library I organized the students' dataframe.
- Using the numpy library I added identifiers to the students.
- With the help of the html5lib and lxml libraries to read a url, in addition to the pandas library to create the dataframe, I created the course table.
- Using the pandas library I changed the index of the courses.
- Using the pandas library, I enrolled students in courses.
- Using the pandas library, I created a dataframe with the frequency of students enrolled per course.
- Additionally, using the sqlalchemy library, I created a sql database to query and write to this database.
- I did the export in json, html and xlsx formats.
